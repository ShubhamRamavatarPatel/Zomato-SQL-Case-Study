# 🍽 Zomato SQL Case Study — Data Analysis Using SQL Server

This repository contains a **real-world style SQL case study** based on a Zomato-like restaurant dataset.  
The project focuses on extracting meaningful insights using **SQL Server (SSMS)**, including:
user-defined functions, stored procedures, triggers, analytical queries, window functions, and reporting queries.

## 📊 **Project Overview**

Restaurants generate large amounts of customer & business data such as ratings, cost, cuisine types, bookings, and reviews.  
In this case study, we perform end-to-end analysis to answer business questions like:

- Which restaurants perform best based on ratings?
- What is the rating status category for each restaurant?
- Top restaurant areas & cuisine preferences
- How do rating trends affect customer choices?
- Restaurant-wise and cuisine-wise analytical breakdown
- Dynamic database operations using SPs, Views & Triggers

This project simulates insights that Zomato or Swiggy might use to improve recommendations,
marketing decisions, and business performance.
